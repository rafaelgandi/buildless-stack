# üåÖ Buildless Stack
A tiny buildless stack for my frontend development.


# UI Library
I use [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) for declarative UI programming and [HTM](https://github.com/developit/htm) as a buildless alternative to JSX. The combined standalone version used in this stack can be found [here.](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/getting-started/#no-build-tools-route)


# CSS Styling
I use [postcss-nesting](https://github.com/csstools/postcss-nesting) built with [esm.sh cdn](https://esm.sh/) as a polyfill for native nested css if it is not supported by a browser. [styled.js](https://github.com/rafaelgandi/buildless-stack/blob/main/public/src/lib/styled.js) is the utility function I made to make this easier to use.


# Types
Since I can't directly annotate my code with Typescript types. I just make a single file(```types.d.ts```) where I place all my Typescript type declarations and reference them using [JSDoc's import syntax](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49836644/how-to-import-a-typedef-from-one-file-to-another-in-jsdoc-using-node-js). This way I somewhat get type autocomplete suggestions in VSCode.


# Import Maps
I use import map to alias some library script that I use. So I don't have to constantly type out their paths. For browsers that don't yet support import maps I use this [shim.](https://github.com/guybedford/es-module-shims#import-maps)


# Finding packages
Since I don't use a bundler in this stack I need a way to consume npm packages in the browser directly. The service that I found useful for this is [jsdelivr.com](https://www.jsdelivr.com/). I just search for the npm package name in the service and it will generate a cdn link I can use to reference directly or save it as a local file. Make sure to choose the ESM version.
You can also use [this tool](https://esm.sh/) in generating es modules for the browser.

# VSCode Extensions
Make sure to install the official [lit-html extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.lit-html) and the [styled-component extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=styled-components.vscode-styled-components) for proper syntax highlighting.

# Running a Local Dev Server
I use Bun as a package manager but any package manager is fine.
```javascript
// ü•ü For bun environment
bun server.js 

// For node environment
node server.js
```
